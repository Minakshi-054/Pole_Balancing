This is how you train
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,4,5,6,7 python train.py 2 24 222 train

firstargs python train.py secondargs thirdargs fourthargs fifthargs

firstargs:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,4,5,6, -> explicitly mention what you want to use

secondargs:
how many gpus are you using across selected gpus

thirdargs:
if you say -1, you mean you wan tto train with everything you have else say 20 means use only 20 data points
this should be used only for sanity check

fourthargs:
number of epochs,
if thirdargs is -1, then you are using only 2 epochs

fifthargs:
